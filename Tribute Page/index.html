        <h1>Professor Charles Babbage</h1>
        <p id="shortInfo">Charles Babbage was an English mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer. He is best
            known for designing the "Analytical Engine," a mechanical general-purpose computer, often considered as an
            early precursor to modern computers. Babbage's work laid the foundation for the development of computer
            technology and the concept of programming. His inventions and ideas greatly influenced the field of computer
            science and technology as we know it today.</p>
